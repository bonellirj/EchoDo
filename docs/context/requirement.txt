Voice Task Creator - Mobile Challenge

What to Build
A simple mobile web app where users can speak to create tasks.

Example: User says "Remind me to call John December 1st at 3pm" → App creates a task with title, date, and time.

Core Features (Must Have)
Voice Input: Tap button to record, uses Web Speech API

Task Creation: Convert speech to a task with title and due date

Task Display: Show created tasks in a simple list

Mobile Friendly: Works well on phones

Technical Requirements
Use Web Speech API: https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/web-speech-api/speech-color-changer/ or better alternative

Mobile-responsive design

Store tasks locally (localStorage is fine)

Handle basic speech recognition errors

Example Voice Commands
“Buy groceries on December 15th”

“Finish project by December 18th at 2 pm”

“Call mom tomorrow at 7pm” (Bonus example)

Success Criteria
☑️ Voice input reliably converts to text
☑️ Creates tasks with title and basic timing
☑️ Mobile interface is clean and usable
☑️ Shows list of created tasks

Bonus Features (If time allows)
Smart Date Parsing: Convert “tomorrow”, “Friday”, “next week” to actual dates

Task Completion: Add checkboxes to mark tasks as done

Deliverables
Working web app (can be a single HTML file)
